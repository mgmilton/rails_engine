# Rails Engine

This project utilizes Ruby on Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes sales data selected from Etsy. This api serves up business analytics, relational endpoints, and record endpoints. For a full explanation of the endpoints, look at this [endpoint explanation](https://github.com/lnchambers/rails_engine/blob/master/endpoint_explanations.md). Below is a database schema explaining the relationships between each endpoint: merchant, customer, items, invoices, transactions and invoice items.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the rails engine API up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites


* Ruby, version 2.5
* Rails, version 5.1.5
* Puma, version 3.7
* Rspec-Rails

After cloning down this repository, change into the directory ```rales_engine``` and run:

```
bundle
```

## Installing

To setup the database necessary for this API, run the following commands:

```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rake import_csv
```
To import a specific csv for a model, see this [explanation](https://github.com/lnchambers/rails_engine/blob/master/csv_import.md).

## Complex Queries

To view some complex data querying run the following:

```
rails c
```

After the console is open:

```
Items.most_items
Items.most_revenue
Transaction.total_revenue_by_date("2012-03-16")
Merchant.first.customers_with_pending_invoices

```


## Running the tests

In order to run the test suite, run the following command:
```
rspec
```

## Break down into end to end tests

* Simple Model Test:

The following test ensures that an invoice has a status and all the appropriate associated data.

```
rspec spec/models/invoice_spec.rb
```

* Complex Model Test:

The following test makes use ten separate [factorybot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) factories to ensure that a merchant has a name and that it has all the appropriate associations(e.g., has many invoices_items through invoices). The class method ```.most_revenue``` selects the top merchants ranked by revenue. The class method ```.most_items``` selects the top merchants ranked by total number of items sold. The instance method ```#top_revenue_by_date```selects the total revenue for a specific merchant on an invoice date.

```
rspec spec/models/merchant_spec.rb
```

* Simple Request Test:

The following test ensures that all invoices associated with a specific customer are returned.

```
rspec spec/requests/api/v1/customers/invoices_request_spec.rb
```


* Complex Request Test:

When a request goes to the invoice_items record endpoint, a user can find an invoice item by id, unit_price, quantity or all invoice items matching a unit price or quantity.

```
rspec spec/requests/api/v1/invoice_items/invoice_items_request_spec.rb
```
